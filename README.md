# MSXVI Strategy
![](docs/architecture.svg)

## About
This repository contains the work of the Midnight Sun ~~Strategy team~~, including code for setting up and interacting with a simulator and optimization algorithms.

## FSGP & ASC
FSGP serves as a qualifying event for ASC. 

    Scoring is based on the highest overall official distance driven or laps completed over the duration of the event with ties being broken by the lowest overall official elapsed time or fastest lap" in other words maximising distance for a fixed time. 

If qualified, the objectives of ASC are the following:

    1. To complete the American Solar Challenge base route without trailering.
    2. To complete as many official miles as possible. (1st Tiebreaker)
    3. To complete the distance in the shortest elapsed time. (2nd Tiebreaker)

Successfully achieving these objectives hinges on two factors: 
- designing an efficient solar car (less power out)
- following an optimal race strategy

Race strategy boils down to a single question:

### **What speed should we drive at?**

We address this question by leveraging the route, weather, and solar irradiance data. 

## Simulator
Still deciding how this will be implemented... Will either be done with simulink or custom python models (leaning towards this right now)

## Optimizer
This module is intended to optimize velocity using the simulation model, and we plan to use SciPy for the optimization. As for the Z3 prover, it appears to be better suited for problems such as: “Given logical constraints x, y, and z, what values can they take?” In our case, we aim to minimize SOC as a function of the chosen speed, so the Z3 prover would not be particularly useful. 

# How to run it? 
```
cd simulation
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
````
Afterwards, you should be able to configure the simulation via terminal. 

# Notes 
So... I don't think we have access to Solcast anymore 💀 We could make the whole terminal thing into a GUI! Still have to test if the map visualization works or not. Also need to set up plots.
